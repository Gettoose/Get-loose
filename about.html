			<p class="Info">
				Sports Massage is the physical manipulation and mobilisation of muscles and soft tissues. By moving,
				pressing and stretching the muscles, tension and pain will be removed and knots and hard areas softened and
				released. Using specific and focused techniques it reaches the deep layers of the muscles enabling a profound
				and lasting relaxation and repair of the muscles. <b>Sports massage</b> helps to restore and maintain healthy,
				flexible and resilient muscles and nerves, improves circulation and oxygenation and supports the mental balance.
				With regular use of massage the body will become more resilient to stress and strains, less vulnerable to
				injuries and improve performance.
			</p>

			<p>When used to treat injuries in order to support and improve recovery it is referred to as <b>Remedial
					massage</b>.
			</p>

			<p>In order to be most efficient the individual treatment routine will be adapted to the client's
				disposition and needs. Therefore a precise consultation is a vital part of every appointment especially the
				initial one. The client's goals and expectations will be discussed and the treatment routine adjusted
				accordingly.</p>

			<p>Also a careful monitoring of their progress and advice regarding supporting exercises and nutrition
				plays an important role in order to deliver a sustainable service to our regular clients and improve their lives
				permanently.
			</p>

			<p>Sports and Remedial massage is a 100% natural way of healing, without the need for drugs, chemicals or
				technical appliances, thus being completely free of side effects, sustainable and ecological.

			<h2 class="paper__heading text-center">Who will benefit from Sports Massage?</h2>

			<p>
				Despite what the name might suggest everyone can benefit from Sports Massage. It is not only highly
				efficient for Athletes and people who are physically active, but also for individuals with a physically
				challenging occupation, those carrying out repetitive movements or people who are inactive, sitting at a desk
				all day. Painful tension, shortened muscles and ligaments, stiffness, decreased range of movement, lack of
				flexibility and poor circulation are often a result of these routines, which can build up over time and lead to
				serious long term issues like postural issues, chronic pain or damage of the muscle if left untreated. Sports
				and Remedial massage helps to alleviate or eliminate the negative impact of these conditions and prevent long
				term damage.
